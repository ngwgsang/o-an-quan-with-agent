The available starting positions for Player A are only A3. The recent memory shows that in the last three rounds, Player A chose A4 and A5 with counter-clockwise direction, focusing on positioning for future captures. The strategic persona suggests focusing on long-term control and setting up future advantages rather than immediate gains. The movement rules require choosing a square with pieces, which in this case is only A3. The distribution direction can be chosen as clockwise or counter-clockwise. The capturing rules allow for capturing if the next square is empty and the one after has pieces, with possible chain captures. The end of the game occurs when both mandarins are captured or a player has no pieces to move. Scoring is based on captured pieces, with mandarins worth more. The task is to choose the best move considering the current state, recent moves, and strategic persona. The available starting square is A3, which has a peasant_b. The direction choice will determine where the pieces are distributed. Considering the strategic persona, the move should aim to create favorable positions for future captures and control. Distributing counter-clockwise from A3 would place pieces into A4, A5, QB, B1, etc. This could potentially set up captures in future moves by creating gaps or weaknesses in the opponent's setup. Alternatively, distributing clockwise would go towards A2, A1, QA, which are mostly empty or have mandarins. Since the strategic focus is on future positioning, counter-clockwise might be more beneficial as it affects more of the opponent's side. Therefore, choosing A3 with a counter-clockwise direction aligns with the strategic persona by setting up future captures and controlling the board.",
