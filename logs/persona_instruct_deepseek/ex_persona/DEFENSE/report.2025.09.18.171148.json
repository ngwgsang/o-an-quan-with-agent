The recent memory shows that in Round 2, Player A chose A2 with a clockwise direction, and in Round 1, A3 with a clockwise direction. The strategy has been cautious and defensive, focusing on building a stable presence and preparing for captures without unnecessary risks. The movement rules require choosing a starting square with pieces, picking up all pieces, and distributing them in a chosen direction. The capturing rules allow for capturing if the next square is empty and the one after has pieces, with potential chain captures. The game ends when both mandarins are captured or a player has no pieces to move. Scoring is based on captured pieces, with mandarins worth more. The persona is cautious, preferring to strengthen defenses before attacking, and maintaining a stable board presence. The task is to choose the best move considering the current state, strategy, and persona. The options are to choose a starting square (A1, A2, A3, A5) and a direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). The reasoning should explain the choice in terms of alignment with the persona and strategy, and the potential outcomes.
