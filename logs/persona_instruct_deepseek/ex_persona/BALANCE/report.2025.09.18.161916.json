However, since A4 is empty now, Player A needs to choose a different starting position. Among the available starting positions (A2, A3, A5), A5 has the most pieces and is closest to QB, making it a strategic choice for capturing. Distributing counter-clockwise from A5 would allow Player A to target QB and B1, potentially capturing multiple pieces and weakening the opponent's defense. This move aligns with the balanced strategy by maintaining offensive pressure while ensuring that Player A's own positions remain strong.",

The recent moves by Player A have focused on capturing pieces from QB and B1 by moving counter-clockwise from A4 and A5. This strategy has been effective in gaining points and weakening Player B's defense. However, Player B still has pieces in QB and B1, indicating that further captures are possible. Additionally, Player B has a piece in B3, which could be a potential target for future captures. The balanced strategy suggests that Player A should continue to apply offensive pressure while maintaining defensive strength. Choosing A5 again with a counter-clockwise direction would allow Player A to distribute pieces towards QB and B1, potentially capturing more of Player B's pieces. This move aligns with the balanced strategy by maintaining offensive pressure while ensuring that Player A's own positions remain strong. The capture of pieces from QB and B1 could lead to a significant point gain and further weaken Player B's defense. Moreover, this move does not leave Player A's positions undefended, as A4 and A5 are still occupied, providing a defensive buffer.",
