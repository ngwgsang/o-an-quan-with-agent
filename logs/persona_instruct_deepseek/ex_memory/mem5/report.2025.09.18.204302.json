The recent memory shows that Player A has been focusing on moves that could potentially capture the opponent's pieces, especially around QB. The balanced strategy suggests that Player A should continue to look for opportunities to capture without overextending and leaving their own side vulnerable. The available starting positions are A2, A4, and A5. Each of these squares has a different number of pieces and potential distribution paths. The direction chosen (clockwise or counter-clockwise) will significantly impact where the pieces are distributed and whether captures can occur. The goal is to select a move that maximizes the chance of capturing opponent pieces while maintaining a strong defensive position.",

The opponent's Mandarin (QB) is occupied by a mandarin_b, which is a high-value target. The recent moves have focused on capturing towards QB, indicating a potential strategy to target the opponent's Mandarin and peasants. The available starting positions for Player A are A2, A3, and A4. Each of these squares has multiple pieces, which can be distributed in a way to potentially capture opponent's pieces. The direction choice (clockwise or counter-clockwise) will determine where the pieces are distributed and which squares are targeted for captures. The Balanced strategy suggests that Player A should look for opportunities to capture high-value pieces while maintaining a strong defensive position. Given the current distribution, choosing A4 with a counter-clockwise direction could allow capturing pieces from B5 and QB, which are high-value targets. This move aligns with the Balanced strategy by focusing on capturing opportunities while maintaining pressure on the opponent's side. Additionally, this move follows the recent successful moves and continues the pressure on the opponent's Mandarin and peasants.",
