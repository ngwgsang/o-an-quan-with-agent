The recent memory indicates that Player A has been targeting QB in previous rounds, which contains a Mandarin and peasants, making it a high-value target. The balanced strategy suggests attacking when there's an opening while maintaining defensive positioning. Choosing A4 with a counter-clockwise direction allows Player A to target QB, potentially capturing the Mandarin and peasants. This move aligns with the balanced strategy of attacking when there's an opening while maintaining defensive positioning. The move follows the previous strategy of targeting QB, which is a high-value target due to the Mandarin and multiple peasants.",
