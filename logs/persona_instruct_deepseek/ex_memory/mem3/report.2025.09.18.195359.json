Considering the recent memory, Player A has been focusing on counter-clockwise distributions from A5, A4, and A2 in previous rounds, targeting Player B's pieces effectively. The balanced strategy suggests a mix of offense and defense, so Player A should look for a move that can capture opponent pieces without leaving their own side vulnerable. Starting from A3 and distributing counter-clockwise could allow capturing pieces in A4, A5, QB, B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5. This direction could potentially capture pieces in QB if the distribution leaves the next square empty and the one after contains pieces. This aligns with the balanced strategy by taking an offensive approach while maintaining defensive strength.

The opponent's last move was in Round 12, but the specific details aren't provided. However, based on the recent memory, Player A has been focusing on offensive strategies by choosing A2, A3, and A4 in previous rounds to target Player B's pieces. The Balanced strategy suggests that Player A should continue to look for opportunities to capture pieces while maintaining a strong defense. Given the available starting positions (A2, A3, A5), each has potential for capturing, but the direction and potential captures need to be evaluated carefully. The goal is to maximize points while ensuring that Player A's pieces are not left vulnerable to counter-captures.",
      "reason": "Choosing A5 as the starting position and distributing counter-clockwise allows Player A to target Player B's pieces in QB, B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5. This direction could potentially capture pieces in QB if the distribution leaves the next square empty and the one after contains pieces. This aligns with the balanced strategy by taking an offensive approach while maintaining defensive strength. The distribution direction is chosen to target the opponent's pieces, which could lead to a higher score gain.",
