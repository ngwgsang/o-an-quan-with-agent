Additionally, distributing counter-clockwise from A3 may lead to capturing pieces from B1 and QB, which aligns with the balanced strategy of taking offensive action while ensuring defensive positioning. This move also strengthens A's defense by filling A4 and A5, making it harder for B to capture from A's side. The significant number of pieces in A3 makes it a strong candidate for distribution, and the counter-clockwise direction targets the opponent's weaker squares first.",
