      "observation": "The current board state shows that Player A has pieces in QA and A4, while Player B has pieces in QB, B2, B4, and B5. The available starting positions for Player A are only A4. Therefore, the only possible move is to choose A4 as the starting square. The direction can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Choosing clockwise would distribute pieces towards A5, QB, B1, B2, etc., while counter-clockwise would go towards A3, A2, A1, QA, etc. Considering the balanced strategy, it's important to evaluate which direction offers the best opportunity for capturing pieces while maintaining defensive positioning. Since QB has a Mandarin piece and surrounding peasants, targeting that area could be beneficial. However, moving counter-clockwise from A4 would first reach A3, which is empty, and then A2, A1, QA, which also has pieces. This might not lead to immediate captures but could strengthen the defense. On the other hand, moving clockwise from A4 would go to A5 (empty), then QB, which has the Mandarin and peasants. This could potentially lead to a capture if the distribution leads to an empty square followed by a square with pieces. Given the current distribution, moving clockwise might offer a better chance to capture pieces in QB, aligning with the offensive aspect of the balanced strategy. Additionally, capturing the Mandarin in QB would significantly boost the score and weaken the opponent. Therefore, choosing A4 with a clockwise direction seems to be the optimal move, balancing both offensive and defensive considerations.",

However, the player must also consider the potential captures and how they might affect the overall game state. The choice of direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) will impact where the pieces are distributed and whether captures can be made. The player should evaluate which starting square and direction maximizes the chance of capturing pieces while maintaining a balanced approach.",
      "reason": "Choosing A3 as the starting square and distributing counter-clockwise allows Player A to target QB while considering the potential captures. This move aligns with the balanced strategy by taking offensive action towards the Mandarin and peasants in QB, but also being cautious about the distribution of pieces to avoid leaving defenses weak. The reasoning is that starting from A3 with a counter-clockwise distribution can lead to capturing pieces in QB and surrounding squares, which is a strategic offensive move that fits the balanced approach.",

The recent memory shows that in previous rounds, the player has chosen A3, A2, and A1, focusing on targeting QB and surrounding squares for potential captures. The current board state shows that QB has a Mandarin and a peasant, which is a valuable target. Additionally, B5 has three peasants, which could be a significant capture if possible. The player needs to decide whether to start from A2 or A4 and whether to go clockwise or counter-clockwise. Starting from A2 with a clockwise distribution would target QB and potentially capture the Mandarin and peasants there. Starting from A4 with a counter-clockwise distribution might allow capturing B5's peasants.
